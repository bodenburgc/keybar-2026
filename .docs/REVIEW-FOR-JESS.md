## Suggestions by Page

### Contact Page
- [ ] **Add phone number?** - The old site didn't have one. Should we add one?
- [ ] **Add contact form?** - Shopify has built-in contact form templates
- [ ] **Business hours?** - Should we list hours of operation?

### Shipping Policy
- [ ] **Add estimated delivery times** - e.g., "FedEx 2Day typically arrives in 2-3 business days"
- [ ] **Confirm free shipping threshold** - Footer mentions "$75+" - is this still accurate?

### Terms & Conditions
- [ ] **Returns form URL** - Need link to the actual returns form
- [ ] **Add "Last Updated" date** - Good practice for legal pages

### Set Up & Care

- [ ] **Add photos/diagrams** - Visual assembly steps would improve clarity

### FAQs
- [ ] **Add accordion/collapsible sections** - Easier to scan (can be done via theme)
