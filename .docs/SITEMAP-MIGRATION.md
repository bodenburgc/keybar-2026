## Pages to Discuss with Jess

| Old Site Page | Question |
|---------------|----------|
| /skalpel/ | **Links to external MTK site** - Is this still active? Just add as external link or skip? |
| /nascar/ | **NASCAR promotion** - Is this current or outdated? Should we migrate? |
| /exclusions/ | **Unknown page** - What is this? Need to check content |
| /sms-giveaway-official-rules/ | **Giveaway rules** - Is there an active giveaway or is this outdated? |
| /join/ | **Newsletter signup?** - Is this just email signup? Shopify has built-in newsletter |
| /request-quote/ | **Custom KeyBar form** - Do you still take custom orders via form? |
| /dealer-application/ | **Dealer application form** - Recreate in Shopify or use external form? |
| /international-dealer-application/ | **International dealers** - Same as above, still active? |

## Blog Posts

The old site has ~10 blog posts. **Question for Jess:** Should we migrate blog content?

| Post | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| "What are people saying about KeyBar?" | ⭐ Migrate - Good testimonials |
| "KeyBar and KeyBar gear, where should I start?" | ⭐ Migrate - Helpful buyer guide |
| "Which KeyBar is right for me?" | ⭐ Migrate - Product selection guide |
| "Cat got your tongue?" | Maybe - Addresses buyer hesitations |
| "Simplify Your Life with KeyBar" | Maybe - Lifestyle content |
| "Blade Show 2021 Wrap Up" | Skip - Dated event recap |
| "KEYBAR'S GOING BACK TO BLADE SHOW!!!" | Skip - Dated announcement |
| "The KeyBar Drift-Lift Project" | Skip - Internal project, not customer-facing |
| "MORE MACHINES MEANS MORE ROOM FOR EXPERIMENTING" | Skip - Internal update |
| "How KeyBar Took a Leap Into the World of Off-Roading" | Maybe - Shows product expansion |
